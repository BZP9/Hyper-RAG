            2. This question mainly tests the details of the information and knowledge in the reference. Avoid general and macro question.
            3. The question must not include any conjunctions such as "specifically", "particularly", "and", "or", "and how", "and what" or similar phrases that imply additional inquiries.
            4. The question must focus on a single aspect or detail from the reference, avoiding the combination of multiple inquiries.
            5. Please design question from the professional perspective and domain factors covered by the reference.
            6. This question need to be meaningful and difficult, avoiding overly simplistic inquiries.
            7. This question should be based on the complete context, so that the respondent knows what you are asking and doesn't get confused.
            8. State the question directly in a single sentence, without statements like "How in this reference?" or "What about this data set?" or "as described in the reference."
